The purpose of this website is to provide a people-oriented workspace for 
using assets open sourced by Ultimate Software under the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/UltimateSoftware/">
https://github.com/UltimateSoftware/</a> GitHub account.

This repository is an adjunct to repositories there, 
to provide examples for learning about how to create and test programs using Ultimate's stuff.
Included here are configuration experiments related to performance.

Our objective is to get you (the developer) to get up and running quickly with fast, stable, and useful apps.

More than that, we hope that you'll consider joining as an employee at Ultimate Software,
which has been rated among the top 10 best places to work among all American companies.

## This website

Source code for this "ulticoder.com" domain is 
<a target="_blank" href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/">
configured</a> to use files created at
<a target="_blank" href="https://ulticoder.github.io">ulticoder.github.io</a>.

The "look and feel" of this site is based on the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/">
"Minimal Mistakes" template</a> initiated using
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/280#event-848084392">
this script</a>, then uploaded to the
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ulticoder/ulticoder.github.io">ulticoder.github.io project on GitHub</a>.

HTML for this site is generated from GitHub Flavored Markdown text stored within the `_posts` folder within that repository.

The HTML is generated twice. Locally, markdown text is generated into HTML by Jekyll which runs under Ruby.
HTML is generated into the `_site` folder.
When uploaded using a Git client, GitHub automatically performs the same processing.
This is why the local `_site` folder is specified in the `.gitignore` file to prevent upload to GitHub.

For now, graphics files shown on this site is displayed from URLs obtained from dragging them onto a GitHub Issues page.
