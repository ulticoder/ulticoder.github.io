## This website

Source code for this "ulticoder.com" domain is 
<a target="_blank" href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/">
configured</a> to use files created for
<a target="_blank" href="https://ulticoder.github.io">ulticoder.github.io</a>.

The "look and feel" of this site is based on the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/">
"Minimal Mistakes" template</a> initiated using
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/280#event-848084392">
this script</a>, then uploaded to the
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ulticoder/ulticoder.github.io">ulticoder.github.io project on GitHub</a>.

HTML for this site is generated from GitHub Flavored Markdown text stored within the `_posts` folder withinthat repository.

The HTML is generated twice. Locally, markdown text is generated into HTML by Jekyll which runs under Ruby.
HTML is generated into the `_site` folder.
When uploaded using a Git client, GitHub automatically performs the same processing.
This is why the local `_site` folder is specified in the `.gitignore` file to prevent upload to GitHub.

For now, graphics files shown on this site is displayed from URLs obtained from dragging them onto a GitHub Issues page.
